<h1>Panin Technical Test</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This project is a mobile application developed using Swift for iOS. The app implements several key features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SwiftUI for UI Development</strong> - The user interface is built using SwiftUI, ensuring a modern, smooth, and responsive user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous JSON Data Fetching</strong> - The app retrieves stock data asynchronously from a JSON file, allowing efficient and seamless data handling.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles</strong> - The project follows Clean Architecture to ensure a well-structured, modular, and maintainable codebase.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> - The architecture divides the app into multiple layers (Data, Domain, and Presentation) to enhance readability and scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong> - Each component has a well-defined responsibility, making the codebase easier to manage and extend.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>SwiftData for Local Data Persistence</strong> - SwiftData is used for local data storage, allowing users to save their stock watchlist efficiently.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Routing and Dependency Injection</strong> - The project implements a structured routing system to manage navigation efficiently, alongside Dependency Injection (DI) to improve code flexibility, testability, and maintainability.
    </li>
    <li><strong>UI & Unit Testing</strong> - The app includes comprehensive UI and Unit tests to ensure stability and correctness across different scenarios.</li>
</ul>
